            <p>The caves are situated on two adjacent hills, Udayagiri and Khandagiri mentioned as Kumari Parvata in the Hathigumpha inscription. </p>
            <p>They have a number of finely carved caves built during the 1st century BCE.
                Most of these caves were carved out as residential blocks for Jain ascetics during the reign of King Kharavela.</p>
